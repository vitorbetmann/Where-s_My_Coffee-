- Created an original game inspired by my barista experience, where players craft drinks using ingredient cards to serve impatient customers.
- Implemented the MVC design pattern to enhance game scalability and enable the development of multiple scenes, including tutorials and character selection, improving player engagement.
- Game rules can be read in the first 3 seconds of the gameplay video.
